GemChemist
==========

A tool to help selling gems in Diablo 3

Objective : The user enters the cost of the different elements to go from one gem to another one.
The webapp shows the total price.
Then the user can set a selling price, and he will be able to see the expected benefit.

It'll be a HTML/CSS/Javascript webapp, using localStorage for some stuff
